    <h2>Catalog of Aerial Warfare</h2>
    <p class="post-date">8 October 2025</p>
    <p>
        I pushed some big changes to the site today. It now features information about the various items that can be added to a Leviathans fleet. These are linked from the fleet builder (the little article icons on the right of the list items) or browsable in the Catalog section of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this first version of the catalog, I've only included information for the leviathans and other options that I've seen printed versions of through either my own Kickstarter pledge or from photos shared by others. That is most but not all of what was available through the Kickstarter. There are some notable differences between the various previews and printed cards, and I want to avoid out-of-date information on the site. If you notice any problems with the listed information or want to help fill some of the gaps, please reach out.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the catalog, today's update also adds the Hindenburg and Vauban fortresses from the Operation: Hannibal campaign box. They don't have points yet, but you can still see their stats and add them to fleets for open play.

        Oh, this News section is new too.
