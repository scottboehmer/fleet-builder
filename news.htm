        <p class="post-date">16 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            Thanks to some help from other folks on the Leviathans discord server, I was able to get the information from the cards I don't own yet. Every ship, captain, admiral, plane, and anti-leviathan gun should now have a details page.

            I added breadcrumb style navigation to the site's pages. I felt this was missing when browsing the catalog, but I went ahead and added it for all of the pages. When in app mode, it also makes it easier to get back to the fleet builder from the card pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also set up the site to have a page for each news post. There is also now an RSS feed for the news posts available at <a href="https://scottboehmer.github.io/fleet-builder/rss.xml">rss.xml</a>.

        <a href="posts/2.htm"><h3>Proper Names & Fleet Summary</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">11 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            I made a few small updates today. First, the names of Leviathans should now be properly italicized on the site. For example, "HML <em>Leviathan</em>" rather than just "HML Leviathan". Second, the fleet builder now has a sticky bar to make it easier to track what has been added to your fleet while scrolling through the long list of options. And finally, I cleaned up the reporting of list-building errors to avoid duplicate entries in the list of errors. Even if you have seven of HML <em>Beagle</em> in your fleet, the list of errors only needs to say "Only one of a given Ship Card may be included" once.

        <a href="posts/1.htm"><h3>Catalog of Aerial Warfare</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">8 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            I pushed some big changes to the site today. It now features information about the various items that can be added to a Leviathans fleet. These are linked from the fleet builder (the little article icons on the right of the list items) or browsable in the Catalog section of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this first version of the catalog, I've only included information for the leviathans and other options that I've seen printed versions of through either my own Kickstarter pledge or from photos shared by others. That is most but not all of what was available through the Kickstarter. There are some notable differences between the various previews and printed cards, and I want to avoid out-of-date information on the site. If you notice any problems with the listed information or want to help fill some of the gaps, please reach out.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the catalog, today's update also adds the Hindenburg and Vauban fortresses from the Operation: Hannibal campaign box. They don't have points yet, but you can still see their stats and add them to fleets for open play.
