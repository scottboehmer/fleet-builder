        <p class="post-date">28 November 2025</p>
        <p>
            The pages for individual ships now include the breach numbers for their slots. I've had the data in the backend for a while, but they are now available to view on the generated pages. As always, let me know if you notice any errors in the data.

        <a href="posts/6.htm"><h3>Copy Markdown</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">28 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            The fleet builder has had the ability to show a markdown version of a fleet for a while now. That was intended to make it easy to copy-paste it to anywhere you wanted with formatting that would work well in apps like Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've taken that a step further now. There is now a button that will add the markdown version of your fleet directly to your clipboard without having to switch to the markdown view or select text. My hope is that this will be easier to use, especially on mobile devices.

        <a href="posts/5.htm"><h3>Required Slots</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">23 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            The fleet builder now has a Required Slots list that can be used to filter the list of leviathans. When one or more of those checkboxes is checked, the list will only show leviathans that have all of the checked slot types. This is intended to give you a quicker way to check for certain items without needing to open all of the individual ship pages. This functionality has been in preview for a little bit, but now it is available by default.

        <p class="post-date">16 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            Thanks to some help from other folks on the Leviathans discord server, I was able to get the information from the cards I don't own yet. Every ship, captain, admiral, plane, and anti-leviathan gun should now have a details page.

            If you notice any errors in the uploaded data, please let me know.

        <p class="post-date">12 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            I added breadcrumb style navigation to the site's pages. I felt this was missing when browsing the catalog, but I went ahead and added it for all of the pages. When in app mode, it also makes it easier to get back to the fleet builder from the card pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also set up the site to have a page for each news post. There is also now an RSS feed for the news posts available at <a href="https://scottboehmer.github.io/fleet-builder/rss.xml">rss.xml</a>.
