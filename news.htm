        <a href="posts/6.htm"><h3>Copy Markdown</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">28 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            The fleet builder has had the ability to show a markdown version of a fleet for a while now. That was intended to make it easy to copy-paste it to anywhere you wanted with formatting that would work well in apps like Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've taken that a step further now. There is now a button that will add the markdown version of your fleet directly to your clipboard without having to switch to the markdown view or select text. My hope is that this will be easier to use, especially on mobile devices.

        <a href="posts/5.htm"><h3>Required Slots</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">23 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            The fleet builder now has a Required Slots list that can be used to filter the list of leviathans. When one or more of those checkboxes is checked, the list will only show leviathans that have all of the checked slot types. This is intended to give you a quicker way to check for certain items without needing to open all of the individual ship pages. This functionality has been in preview for a little bit, but now it is available by default.

        <p class="post-date">16 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            Thanks to some help from other folks on the Leviathans discord server, I was able to get the information from the cards I don't own yet. Every ship, captain, admiral, plane, and anti-leviathan gun should now have a details page.

        <p class="post-date">12 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            I added breadcrumb style navigation to the site's pages. I felt this was missing when browsing the catalog, but I went ahead and added it for all of the pages. When in app mode, it also makes it easier to get back to the fleet builder from the card pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also set up the site to have a page for each news post. There is also now an RSS feed for the news posts available at <a href="https://scottboehmer.github.io/fleet-builder/rss.xml">rss.xml</a>.

        <a href="posts/2.htm"><h3>Proper Names & Fleet Summary</h3></a>
        <p class="post-date">11 October 2025</p>
        <p>
            I made a few small updates today. First, the names of Leviathans should now be properly italicized on the site. For example, "HML <em>Leviathan</em>" rather than just "HML Leviathan". Second, the fleet builder now has a sticky bar to make it easier to track what has been added to your fleet while scrolling through the long list of options. And finally, I cleaned up the reporting of list-building errors to avoid duplicate entries in the list of errors. Even if you have seven of HML <em>Beagle</em> in your fleet, the list of errors only needs to say "Only one of a given Ship Card may be included" once.
